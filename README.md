#WDiPSUM

Here's a simple little ipsum generator filled with inside jokes from the Web Development Immersive Class I taught at General Assembly.  You can check out the app [here](https://wdipsum.herokuapp.com).

Here's the very, _ahem_, lean tech stack:

* a tiny Express app to serve the index.html file
* an Angular app to handle the ipsum generation
* Gulp to manage the build process
* the [ngClip library](https://github.com/asafdav/ng-clip), which is basically a custom directive wrapper for the [ZeroClipboard library](https://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboard)
